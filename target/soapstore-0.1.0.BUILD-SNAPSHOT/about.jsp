    <p>
        The soap you see available online is all made by hand by Tracy Hammond, a late-in-life aficionada of all things all-natural.
        After raising her two children, she took to filling her newly-empty nest with a wide-array of arts-and-crafts, and her focus soon shifted to soap.
        Trained as a nurse, she was acutely aware of the value in a holistic approach to personal health, and soap proved a direct way to improve the quality of life of her friends and family.
        After others began to share her wares, the secret got out; Tracy's Handmade Soaps do far more than clean!

        Whether you give the soap to friends or family or simply spoil yourself, Tracy's Handmade Soaps are sure to be enjoyed!
